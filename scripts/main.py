"""
Fixture generation script for nicovideo provider tests.

This script uses authentication credentials to fetch actual responses from the Niconico API
and saves them as static fixtures for testing.

Note:
Fixtures generated with user credentials will contain personal user data.
Always submit fixtures created with a dedicated test account only.

Usage:
1. Set the NICONICO_SESSION environment variable
2. Run this script: python scripts/main.py
3. Fixture files will be generated in the fixtures/ directory
4. Copy generated fixtures to Music Assistant server repository

Authentication:
Environment variable (NICONICO_SESSION) is required for security.
This prevents accidental commits of hardcoded credentials.
